# MultiStopWatch
This a simple Android app that I created to practice the usage of threads to multitask and viewmodels to maintain state.

Here is what the app does:
1. Provides six stopwatches for counting in seconds or milliseconds
2. Allows the stopwatches to be paused, resumed, and reset independently
3. Allows for changing all stopwatches from counting in seconds to milliseconds and vise versus dynamically
4. Maintains state when the device is rotated
5. Uses the Texas Longhorns color scheme

This app doesn't use any permissions. Please obtain a compiled and digitally signed copy via the Android Play Store.

You can review the code at this repository if you are interested.

Thanks!
